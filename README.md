# PDF Export of PGP Survey Questions

Currently, the Harvard Personal Genome Project website provides a CSV export of the public results for each survey. While these CSVs have headers, the list of possible answers is not available.

As a temporary quickfix, I printed out to PDF the 13 surveys with publicly available results, as a temporary dump of both the survey questions and answer choices. Google Forms has a nice (css? javascript?) ctrl-p function. When you hit "ctrl-p" on the editable version of the form, it prints out a form you could fill out by hand (with all the options expanded).

For the "Participant Survey", which involved extensive dropdown menus (year and country), I printed out two version: one with all the choies (printed from the "editable" page) and one as the participant sees it, with the dropdown minimized (printed from the "submit" page).

I have included a CSV export of the responses as well (the filenames include a timestamp). For the most up-to-date dump of responses, see: https://my.pgp-hms.org/google_surveys

To make it easy to cross-reference the survey questions and the survey responses, I prefixed each file with the "PGP HMS Google Survey" number. These indices can also be found in the URL in the table below. For instance, Blood is marked with `[08]`.

# Todo

* Add these survey questions directly to the Tapestry website (https://my.pgp-hms.org/google_surveys), alongside the responses which are already available on there.
* Write a google script to allow import and export in something easy to parse (for instance, markdown).
